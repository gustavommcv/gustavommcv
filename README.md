# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, World, I'm Gustavo Monnerat! 

### Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm passionate about programming and constantly learning new things.

Currently, Iâ€™m improving my software development skills by studying documentation and working on practical projects.

Most of my repos are **private** because progress is... well, progress.  
Once they evolve from _"just messing around"_ to _"actually working"_, Iâ€™ll share them here. Until then, theyâ€™re safely marinating in my local repos.

## Currently Studying

- **Go** â€” For its performance, elegant simplicity, and because gophers are adorable
- **Linux** â€” To truly understand the OS that powers (almost) everything
- **Shell Scripting** â€” Because automating repetitive tasks feels like a superpower
- **JavaScript, HTML & CSS** â€” Building things from scratch without unnecessary frameworks
