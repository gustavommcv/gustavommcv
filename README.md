# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, World, I'm Gustavo Monnerat! 

### About me
I'm a software developer and a postgraduate student in Software Architecture. Currently, Iâ€™m diving deep into Go (Golang) and absolutely loving the journey! While Iâ€™m still sharpening my skills, Iâ€™m already working on full-stack freelance projects using technologies like Gin, Angular, React, and Express.js. My focus is on continuous growth â€” contributing to open source and private projects, and building meaningful solutions.

Most of my repos are **private** because progress is... well, progress.  
Once they evolve from _"just messing around"_ to _"actually working"_, Iâ€™ll share them here. Until then, theyâ€™re safely marinating in my local repos.
