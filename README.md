# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, World, I'm Gustavo Monnerat! 

### About me
I am a Software Developer and a postgraduate student in Software Architecture, currently focusing on Go (Golang) in my studies.
I work as a full-stack freelancer, developing projects with technologies such as Gin, Express.js (Node), React, Angular, Docker, and AWS.
I am always eager to learn more and contribute to relevant projects, whether in open-source or private solutions, with the goal of building well-structured and efficient systems.

Most of my repos are **private** because progress is... well, progress.  
Once they evolve from _"just messing around"_ to _"actually working"_, Iâ€™ll share them here. Until then, theyâ€™re safely marinating in my local repos.
