# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

### Hey! I'm Gustavo Monnerat. Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm passionate about programming and constantly learning new things.

Currently, Iâ€™m improving my software development skills by studying documentation and working on practical projects.

Most of my repos are **private** because progress is... well, progress.  
Once they evolve from _"just messing around"_ to _"actually working"_, Iâ€™ll share them here. Until then, theyâ€™re safely marinating in my local repos.

## Currently Studying

- **Go** â€” Performance and simplicity
- **Linux** â€” Mastering the OS that runs the world
- **Shell Scripting** â€” Automating all the things
- **JavaScript, HTML & CSS** â€” Pure code over bloat
