# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, World, I'm Gustavo Monnerat! 

### About me
My name is Gustavo Monnerat, I'm a software developer and a postgraduate student in Software Architecture.
I work as a full-stack freelancer, developing projects with technologies such as Gin, Express.js (Node), React, Angular, Docker and AWS.

Most of my repos are **private** because progress is... well, progress.  
Once they evolve from _"just messing around"_ to _"actually working"_, Iâ€™ll share them here. Until then, theyâ€™re safely marinating in my local repos.
