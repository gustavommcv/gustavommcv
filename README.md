# Gus::Monnerat

## A bit about me

Hey! I'm Gustavo Monnerat — welcome to my corner of GitHub where `sleep()` is rarely called.  
I’m a tech enthusiast constantly chasing better code, cleaner commits, and fewer stack overflows (the crashes, not the website).

## What I'm coding on

Right now, my projects are **private** because progress is... well, progress.  
Once they evolve from "just messing around" to "actually works", I'll toss them up here. Until then, they're safely marinating in my local repos.

## What I'm studying

Right now, I'm diving into:  
- **Go** — because performance and simplicity rock
- **Linux** — mastering the OS that runs the world
- **Shell scripting** — automating all the things
- **JavaScript, HTML & CSS** — because pure code beats bloat any day

## Only for nerds

### My Notebook

**Model:** Lenovo S145 — not fancy, but gets the job done  
**Graphics:** Vega 8  
**Processor:** Ryzen 5 3500U  
**RAM:** 12GB (1x8GB + 1x4GB) at 2400MHz — asymmetrical, just like my sleep schedule

**Operating System:** Arch Linux (btw) — consistency is key.

If you made it here, you’ve already put more effort into this than I usually do writing commit messages.
