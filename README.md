# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, World, I'm Gustavo Monnerat! 

### About me

I'm passionate about programming and I'm always learning new things.

Currently, I'm leveling up my software development skills by studying books and docs, and building practical projects.

Most of my repos are **private** because progress is... well, progress.  
Once they evolve from _"just messing around"_ to _"actually working"_, Iâ€™ll share them here. Until then, theyâ€™re safely marinating in my local repos.
