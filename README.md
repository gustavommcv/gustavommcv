# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

### Hey! I'm Gustavo Monnerat, welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm passionate about programming and constantly learning new things.

Currently focusing on deepening my understanding of software development through hands-on projects.  

Most of my repos are **private** because progress is... well, progress.
Once they evolve from "just messing around" to "actually works", I'll share them here. Until then, they're safely marinating in my local repos.

## Current Focus

- **Go** â€” performance and simplicity
- **Linux** â€” mastering the OS that runs the world
- **Shell scripting** â€” automating everything
- **JavaScript, HTML & CSS** â€” pure code over bloat
